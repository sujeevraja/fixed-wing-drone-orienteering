     * This map can be used to find the upper bound at any time. Its values are the upper bounds
     * of LP solutions of all unsolved (or solving) leaf nodes that may have a fractional solution.
     * This map is modified in two cases:
     *
     * - When we branch on a node to create child nodes, the node's LP objective is an upper bound
     *   to the solution of all child nodes. This LP objective is tagged with each child node's id
     *   and placed in this mpa.
     *
     * - When we receive a solved node in [processNode], it will cease to be a leaf node as we will
     *   either prune it or branch from it. So, its id (and corresponding value) will be removed
     *   from this map.
     *
     * The main idea of correctness of this upper bound is that at any time during the evolution of
     * the branch and bound tree, the leaf nodes always describe the solution space completely. If
     * leaf nodes are known to be integral, they contribute to the lower bound. If leaf nodes may
     * be fractional (as they haven't been solved yet), upper bounds on their objectives
     * (identified as the LP objective of their immediate parents) become candidates for upper
     * bounds. The global upper bound then becomes the maximum of upper bounds of all unsolved
     * nodes.
